# 👋 Hi, I'm Tanja — Rust Engineer

Welcome to **tanja-rust**, my space for Rust projects, tools and experiments.  
I’ve been working professionally with **Rust for over 2 years**, building backend services, internal tooling, and systems that require performance, safety and reliability.

### 🔧 What I work with
- Rust (async, tokio, reqwest, serde)
- Axum / Actix
- SQL + ORMs (SeaORM, SQLx)
- Cloud services & distributed systems
- AWS (S3, Lambda, EventBridge)
- Data processing and automation tools

### 📌 Projects in this organization
Here you'll find:
- 🔹 **Property Price Tracker** – a Rust backend service demonstrating SeaORM, Axum, async patterns, and real-world inspired API design
- 🔹 Small focused tools showcasing Rust patterns  
- 🔹 Systems programming exercises  
- 🔹 Libraries and utilities I've built while learning or improving Rust  

More projects are coming as I expand my Rust portfolio.

### 🎯 What I’m currently focused on
- Improving async Rust patterns  
- Building reliable backend services  
- Designing clean error handling  
- Creating practical showcase projects for interviews  

If you’d like to collaborate, or want to check more of my work, feel free to connect.
